## Applies to [All languages]

# Wrapper structure
All wrappers should follow a similar structure to preserve ease for the end user (the developer using our wrapper).

**Backend** - How the wrapper works behind the scenes. <br>
**Frontend** - How the end user interacts with our wrapper.

## Frontend
A few general rules for frontend:
 - All classes used in front end **must** be prefixed with "Hypixel" e.g. `HypixelPlayer` `HypixelGuild` `HypixelSkyblockProfile` (there may be few exceptions)
 - Between languages, all class names **must** be the same. If you are unsure of any names for your language, refer to other wrappers source code.</br></br>
 - All methods inside a front-end class **must** contain the same methods, and names.
 - If a method inside a front-end class isn't easy to understand, please annotate it. You can find how to annotate in your appropriate language conventions.
